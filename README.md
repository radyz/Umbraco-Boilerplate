Umbraco-Boilerplate
===================

# Overview

This project runs as a Web Application within Visual Studio. It uses Umbraco v6.1.3, although you can change the version number in the package.config file (you would have to update the backend files manually though and check any database changes made from version to version). The .bak file can be found within the backup folder. The project has already been installed and you can get access to the backend through the admin user: login => admin, password => p@ssw0rd.
